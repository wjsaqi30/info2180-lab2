	Computer has advance a long way from the 19th century to being integrated in our daily lives. In the 20th century electronic 	computers could take up an entire room, in those times it took a lot of parts to operate a computer. These computer had limited 	purpose and accessbility as uit was used for only millitary and scientific uses. As decades past computer part were made smaller 	and so a computer could have more functionality than one that filled an entire room. Computers that once filled a entire room and 	fit into the palm of our hands.

	Advancements in computers has continue until were are able to go the reaches of space, with the help of computer more complex 	calculation can be acheived. Computers creates many oportunites to for multiple fields such as software development. These 	opportunities create ways to machine learning, artifical intelligence even quantum computer, with the internet connected to all 	computers in todays society create unlimited potential of computing. As we go futher into the future computer will be able to 	advance further to unlock further possibilites.
